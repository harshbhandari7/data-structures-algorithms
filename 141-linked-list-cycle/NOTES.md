The **fast and slow pointe**r technique (also known as the tortoise and hare algorithm) uses two pointers to determine traits about directional data structures. This can be an array, singly-linked list, or a graph. It is often applied to determine if there are any cycles in the data structure and is therefore also known as **Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm.**
​
Slow pointer and fast pointer are simply the names given to two pointer variables. The only difference is that, slow pointer travels the linked list one node at a time where as a fast pointer travels the linked list two nodes at a time.
​
This concept can be used in cases like detecting a loop in a graph, finding the middle node of a linked list (better time complexity), flattening a linked list etc.
